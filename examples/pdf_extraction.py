"""
Basic PDF invoice extraction example using ToolFront.

NOTE: This is a BASIC example demonstrating simple invoice extraction.
It has NOT been tested for complex scenarios like:
- Extracting data from 1000+ page PDFs
- Finding every person mentioned across a large document
- Processing scanned or low-quality PDFs
